[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wmeints/Neuromatic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wmeints/Neuromatic)

A neural network abstraction for C# inspired by Keras. This project aims to make the use of CNTK and Tensorflow
more straightforward from a C# developer perspective. It provides an easy to use abstraction so that you can experiment
quicker and get your models in production quicker.
